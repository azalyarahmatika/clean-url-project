## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For CSS Pre-Processor


### What I learned

This project has been a significant learning experience for me, particularly because it's the first time I've integrated Next.js and SCSS. I've gained valuable insights into managing environment variables within Next.js and honed my skills in utilizing SCSS for styling purposes. This hands-on approach has greatly enhanced my understanding of web development, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned to future projects.

### Continued development

I'm planning to evolve this project into a full-stack application with additional features such as user authentication and multiple pages. This will involve integrating backend technologies to handle user authentication and building out various pages to enhance the overall functionality of the application. By expanding this project, I aim to further develop my skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as gain experience in building complex, real-world applications.
